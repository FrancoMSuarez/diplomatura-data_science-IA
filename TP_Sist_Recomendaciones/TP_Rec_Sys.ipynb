    "\n",
    "1. **Desarrollo de la matriz de Usuario-Contenido:** A partir del conjunto de datos deberán generar una matriz de usuario-contenido. Tener en cuenta que los ratings son implícitos, puesto que se dan a partir de la cantidad de veces que un usuario escuchó a determinado artista.\n",
    "2. **Entrenamiento del algoritmo de recomendación**: Utilizando las herramientas brindadas por [Surpr!se](http://surpriselib.com/), entrenen varios modelos (al menos 3) de sistemas de recomendación basados en filtrado colaborativo a partir de su matriz de usuario-contenido. Recuerden tener en cuenta lo aprendido en la diplomatura a la hora de evaluar y validar el modelo. Si necesitan inspiración, les recomendamos revisar [este notebook con información de como entrenar un sistema de recomendación con Surpr!se](https://github.com/susanli2016/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/Building%20Recommender%20System%20with%20Surprise.ipynb).\n",
    "3. **Sistema de recomendación**: A partir del mejor modelo de recomendación que haya surgido del caso anterior, y utilizando los datos del archivo `artist.dat`, armar un sistema de recomendación sencillo que, dado un nombre de un artista, devuelva el top 10 de artistas más similares. La idea es que el sistema tome el nombre de un artista y devuelva el nombre de otros artistas (no simplemente tomar y devolver IDs). Se recomienda [revisar este notebook para inspiración (ver el paso número 5)](https://github.com/topspinj/pydata-workshop/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb)."

    "\n",
    "Este ejercicio lo deberán completar quienes hayan realizado ambas partes de la materia pues requiere de los conocimientos adquiridos en las segundas dos clases. En este caso, utilizarán no sólo la información de la matriz de usuario-contenido, sino que deberán hacer uso de otra información para poder lidiar con el problema del \"Cold Start\", i.e. que es lo que ocurre cuando tengo nuevos usuarios o artistas. Tener en cuenta los siguientes pasos:\n",
    "1. **Evaluación sobre cold start**: Para evaluar como funciona el sistema con el problema del \"cold start\", deberán tomar ciertos artistas y \"dejarlos fuera\", i.e. remover cualquier participación del artista en el sistema. Esos serán los artistas que se evaluarán como \"cold start\".\n",
    "2. **Vectores de contenido**: Deberán generar vectores de contenido para los artistas, basados en los tags que los usuarios les dan (ver los archivos `user_taggedartists.dat` y `tags.dat`).\n",
    "3. **Sistema de recomendación**: Deberán crear un sistema de recomendación que tomará como parámetros la información del artista (i.e. nombre y tags). Con dicha información, deberán disponer de un sistema de recomendación híbrido (utilizando cualquiera de las técnicas vistas en clase) que devuelva artistas similares. El sistema de recomendación deberá utilizar toda la información proporcionada para dar una mejor respuesta.\n",
    "4. **Evaluación del sistema**: Deberán evaluar \"a mano\" el sistema sobre artistas que conozca y artistas que no conozca (i.e. que fueron dejados afuera), y hacer un análisis de lo que el sistema está devolviendo."
